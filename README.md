#### Main Achievements

<!-- - [x] Development with clean code
- [x] Development with user friendly design -->

1. **Development with Clean Code:** The implementation of the application strictly adhered to Clean Code principles, ensuring clean, readable and highly organized code. This resulted in easy-to-maintain code, facilitating future expansions and adjustments.

2. **Friendly User Interface:** The emphasis on usability and user experience has been reflected in a friendly and intuitive user interface. Users can navigate the app with ease, ensuring a pleasant and efficient experience.

3. **MVVM Architecture Pattern:** The choice to implement the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture brought a clear separation between business logic, user interface and data representation. This not only made the code more modular, but also made it easier to maintain and continually develop.

4. **Maintenance Facilitation:** The adoption of the MVVM standard contributed significantly to facilitating application maintenance. The distinct layers of the architecture allow updates to be made in isolation, reducing the risk of introducing unintentional errors.

5. **Development Improvement:** The MVVM architecture also accelerated the development process by allowing different teams to work independently on different parts of the application. This resulted in greater productivity and development efficiency.
